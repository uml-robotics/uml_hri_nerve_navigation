# UML HRI Nerve Navigation

## About:
  The UML HRI Nerve Navigation package is used for performing several navigation tests that help quantify important characteristics of a navigating robot. Examples of these characteristics include the performance of a robot's path planner and the peformance of a robot's obstacle detection algorithms. A navigation test consists of an environment with a set of goals. The robot will start the test at a starting goal and then navigate to the rest of the goals in sequential order.  A single iteration of a navigation test will be completed once the robot navigates back to the starting goal. To measure the repeatability of the robot's performance, a full navigation test will consist of multiple iterations of the robot traveling to all of the goals and then back to the starting goal. After the test is complete, characteristics of a navigating robot can be found by comparing the robot's performace to the theoretical performance or the performace of a difference robot that completed  the same test. Depending on the configuration of the environement, different characteristics can be more easily measured than others.  For example, if one wanted to measure how well a robot can avoid small obstacles, small cubes can be inserted into the navigation environment.  The image below shows an example of a navigation test environment with two goals, A and B.

## UML HRI Nerve Navigation Package Suite Setup:
1. Clone this repository and the Nav Sim Resources repository and into your catkin workspace.
  > cd ~/<your_ws>/src   
  > git clone https://github.com/uml-robotics/uml_hri_nerve_navigation.git    
  > git clone https://github.com/uml-robotics/uml_hri_nerve_nav_sim_resources.git   
2. Attempt to build your catkin workspace (will fail building helps with later steps).   
  > cd ..  
  > catkin build   
3. Source the workspace.  
  > source devel/setup.bash   
4. Install package dependencies   
  > rosdep update   
  > rosdep install uml_hri_nerve_navigation  
  > rosdep install uml_hri_nerve_nav_sim_resources   

  If this fails, all of the packages needed are in the package.xml file and use sudo apt install ros-[ROS_VERSION]-[PKG_NAME] to install the necessary packages
5. Build your catkin workspace.   
  > cd ..  
  > catkin build   
6. Source the workspace.  
  > source devel/setup.bash
7. Also, a setup bash script must be ran in the UML HRI Nerve Nav Sim Resources package before running any simulations
  > roscd uml_hri_nerve_nav_sim_resources    
  > . setup.sh [# for gazebo version (7 if kinetic and 9 if melodic)]

At this point, if all goes well, all of the uml navigation packages should be ready to run.  

**NOTE BEFORE STARTING:** Sometimes Gazebo can be a bit finicky, and may fail to launch properly for an array of reasons. If something goes wrong, Ctrl+c and try again a few times. If the problem persists there may be an actual issue that needs to be resolved first.    
**NOTE BEFORE STARTING:** If Melodic is being used, there are issues with the fetch simulation package and the robot will not operate properly in simulation.  Also, Melodic has an issue with processing the 2d argument in the higher level launch files and the value should be manually changed.


## Running a Test:   
There are two main ways to run a test:
1. Launch the desired level launch file with the start_test argument set to true. By setting the start_test argument to true, the robot will automatically start performing a navigation test and will stop running once the test finishes. 

    The following command runs a test on level1 in simulation with the fetch robot and the robot performs 10 iterations
    > roslaunch uml_hri_nerve_navigation level1.launch start_test:=true sim:=true robot:=fetch iterations:=10

2. Launch the desired level launch file with the start_test argument set to false. By setting the start_test argument to false, the robot will not start navigating automatically, but you can control when the robot starts navigating and also perform multiple tests in the same Gazebo environment. To start a test, launch the start_test.launch file.

    The following command sets up a test on level4 in simulation with the pioneer robot.
    > roslaunch uml_hri_nerve_navigation level4.launch start_test:=false sim:=true robot:=fetch

    Then following command starts a navigation test with 20 iterations.
    > roslaunch uml_hri_nerve_navigation start_test.launch start_test:=true sim:=true robot:=fetch iterations:=10   

**Note:** If you running a physical test, the amcl node will initialize to the coordinate (0,0) which is probably not where the robot is actually located. To fix this, launch a world file with start_test set to false and before starting the test, use the approximate position tool in RViz to initialize the robot to the correct location.

## Defining Test Goals:
The robots can be configured to navigate to multiple goal locations in a given test.  To set the goals for a navigation test:
1. Create a folder in the goals folder and name the folder whatever the world_name argument is in the desired environment's launch file
2. Create two CSV files, the first one called goals.csv and the second one called obstacle_bot_goals.csv.  Goals.csv defines goals for the main test robot to follow and obstacle_bot_goals.csv defines goals for the obstacle bot to follow.
3. Launch the desired world with the start_test argument set to false and launch RViz. Then, in another terminal, run a rostopic echo on the /clicked_point topic. Using the publish point tool, click desired goal locations on the map and record the coordinates for the point that are displayed in the terminal running the rostopic echo command.
4. In the CSV files, column 1 defines the goal names, column 2 defines the x coordinates, column 3 defines the y coordinates, and column 4 defines the goal yaws. When the goal_publisher node reads the file, the first row is ignored, so feel free to add headers for the columns or just leave the first row blank.  Rows 2 and on will define a new goal for the robot to navigate to. The robot will navigate to the goals from top to bottom in the order defined by the CSV.  Thus, the starting goal for the test will be the goal defined in row 2 of the CSV file.
5. If you need an example to refer to, look at the maps that already have goals defines such as nerve1_base_world.


## Stopping the Test:
If the level launch file is run with the start_test argument set to true, then the launch file will automatically stop running once the test finishes.  If the level launch file is run with the start_test argument set to false, the start_test launch file will automatically stop running once the test finishes, but the level launch file needs to be closed manually with 'Ctrl+c'.

If things inevitably go wrong, shutdown all the launch files with 'Ctrl+c', and start the estop to ensure the robot will stop moving via:  
  > roslaunch uml_hri_nerve_navigation estop.launch  

If in simulation and the robot gets stuck or leaves the desired navigation area, the position of the robot can be reset via:
  > roslaunch uml_hri_nerve_navigation reset_robot.launch  

## Adding a New Navigation Environment:
1. **Creating a Gazebo world in the UML HRI Nerve Nav Sim Resources package if the environment is going to be simulated**  
For more information on adding a simulated world to the UML HRI Nerve Nav Sim Resources package, refer to the UML HRI Nerve Nav Sim Resources documentation
2. **Creating a navigation map**    
Launch the map_environment.launch file specifing the world_path if in simulation.  By launching the map_environment launch file, the robot will launch all of the necessary nodes to perform navigation mapping.  The robot will automatically generate a map by using the robot's sensor data, but the robot must move throughout the entire environment in order to map the entire environemnt.  To move the robot, follow the terminal instructions to move the robot around using your keyboard.  When mapping, it is recommended to launch RViz to view the current map and ensure that there are not any chuncks missing from the map.
3. **Save the maps after mapping the entire environment**    
Launch the save_maps.launch file specifing the map_name argument as the name for the current environment.  Whatever the map_name argument was specified as will become the value of the world_name argument in the level launch file.
4. **Defining test goals**    
To define goals for a test inside a given environment, follow the instructions provided under the Defining Test Goals section.
5. **Creating a level launch file**   
To create a level launch file, copy one of the premade level launch files in both the navigation and name the launch files to whatever you saved the map as in Step 3. Then change the values of the world dependent arguments such as world_name, world_path, and spawn locations.  To figure out what each argument does, refer to the Important Launch Files section below in this README.

  Example command for launching RViz for the pioneer robot
  >roslaunch uml_hri_nerve_navigation rviz.launch robot:=pioneer

* **setup_<Desired_Robot>.launch** - Sets up the robot that is being used in the test.  If the test is in simulation and Gazebo is running, the robot will be spawned into the Gazebo environment, otherwise the necessary setup to run a physical robot will be performed.  This launch file includes a launch file inside of the /launch/robots folder depending on which robot is being used and whether the test is in simulation or not.     
**Arguments:**
  * **level (default: true)** - String argument that specifies the name of the static navigation map for the current environment.
  * **navigate (default: true)** - Boolean argument that specifies whether the robot should launch in navigation mode or in mapping mode.

The logs are sorted out by the time, current robot, and current environment.  The logs can be found in the resources/logs folder.   
**Arguments:**
  * **level** - String argument that specifies the name of the current environment. Used for naming the log files.
  * **robot** - String argument that specifies the current robot used in the test. Used for naming the log files.

  > roslaunch uml_hri_nerve_navigation start_loggers.launch level:=level1 robot:=fetch

* **save_maps.launch** - This launch file is responsible for saving the maps created by gmapping and octomap_server. To create a map, refer to the Adding a New Navigation Environment section above.  The maps are saved to the resources/static_maps folder and are seperated by whether the map is created using gmapping or octomap_server.   
**Arguments:**
  * **map_name** - String argument that specifies the name of the current environment. Used for naming the log files.
  * **2d (default: true)** - Boolean argument that specifies whether to save the 2d map created by gmapping or not.

## Automated Navigation Tester (ANT)
The TestRunner class takes in a JSON file which contains the test definition. The TestRunner class parses the JSON file passed in and sets up the test scenario based on the information. There are two member functions currently present in the TestRunner which can be used to run multiple iterations of the test scenario automatically:
* **run_test_repeatedly(num_repetitions)** - Using this function for running tests quits and restarts all the launch files such as gazebo, map server, etc.
* **run_test_in_person(num_repetitions)** - Using this function for runs gazebo simulation and map server only once and at the end of each iterations it deletes the robot models and kills the other launch files. At the end of each test iteration, there should be a string "continue" published to the /tester_status topic for continuing running another iteration of the test. This feature can be useful when setting up a physical robot back at its starting position after an iteration is ended.

  Example command to start the tester:
  > rosrun uml_hri_nerve_navigation test_runner_node

  Currently the tester takes number of iterations and name of the test definition JSON file through keyboard (stdin).

  Following command can be used to publish string "continue" to /tester_status topic:
  > rostopic pub /tester_status std_msgs/String "data: 'continue'"

  **Note**: The way the tester is setup currently requires test definition JSON file to be placed under the test_defs directory. A sample test definition JSON file is present in the test_defs directory. All test definition files should follow same syntax as the sample file.
